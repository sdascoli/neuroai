Sleep stage classification
==========================

| **Name**: sleep stage
| **Category**: sleep
| **Dataset**: :py:class:`~neuralset.studies.Kemp2000` (SleepEDFx)
| **Objective**: :bdg-info:`Multiclass classification`
| **Split**: Leave-subjects-out

Usage
~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   neuralbench eeg sleep_stage

.. dropdown:: Show ``config.yaml``

   .. literalinclude:: ../../../../neuralbench-repo/neuralbench/tasks/eeg/sleep_stage/config.yaml
      :language: yaml


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The sleep stage classification task involves categorizing segments of EEG data into different sleep stages based on established sleep scoring criteria [Rechtschaffen1968]_. The dataset used for this task is the Sleep-EDF dataset, which contains whole-night polysomnographic recordings from healthy subjects [Kemp2000]_.

Only sleep stage labels N1, N2, N3, REM, and Wake are considered for this task. Other labels such as Movement time and Unknown are excluded.

Dataset Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Recordings are cropped to start 30 minutes before the first occurrence of a sleep stage and end 30 minutes after the last occurrence of a sleep stage to avoid imbalances due to long periods of wakefulness at the beginning and end of the recordings.

Additional Datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following additional polysomnography datasets can also be used with this task:

* ``Ghassemi2018You`` (PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2018) -- 1,985 whole-night recordings annotated for sleep stage and arousal; only the labelled training split is used here [Ghassemi2018You]_.
* ``Alvarez2022Haaglanden`` (HMC) -- 151 whole-night polysomnographic recordings from clinical sleep-center patients [Alvarez2022Haaglanden]_.

To run with an alternate dataset:

.. code-block:: bash

   neuralbench eeg sleep_stage --dataset alvarez2022haaglanden
