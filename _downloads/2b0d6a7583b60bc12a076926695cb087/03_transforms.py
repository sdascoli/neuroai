Transforms
==========

An :class:`~neuralset.events.transforms.EventsTransform` modifies the
events DataFrame — filtering rows, adding columns, splitting into
train/test, linking text context, etc.  Transforms sit between a
:term:`Study` (which produces events) and :term:`extractors <Extractor>`
(which consume them).
"""

# %%
# Applying a Transform
# --------------------
#
# Load events from a study, then apply a transform.
# :class:`~neuralset.events.transforms.QueryEvents` is the most common
# one — it filters events after the study has been fully loaded and
# cached.  (Compare with ``Study(query=...)`` which filters *timelines*
# before loading — coarser but avoids building unwanted timelines.)
# Because it's fast, ``QueryEvents`` itself doesn't need caching:

import neuralset as ns
from neuralset.events import transforms

study = ns.Study(name="Fake2025Meg", path=ns.CACHE_FOLDER)
events = study.run()
print(f"Before: {len(events)} events, types: {events.type.unique().tolist()}")

# %%

query = transforms.QueryEvents(query="type in ['Word', 'Meg']")
events = query(events)

print(f"After QueryEvents: {len(events)} events, types: {events.type.unique().tolist()}")

# %%
# In Practice: Chain
# ------------------
#
# Applying transforms one-by-one is fine for exploration, but in real
# configs you want a single object that bundles a study with its
# transforms.  :class:`~neuralset.base.Chain` sequences a study and
# transforms into a reproducible, cacheable pipeline:

chain = ns.Chain(
    steps=[
        {"name": "Fake2025Meg", "path": str(ns.CACHE_FOLDER)},
        {"name": "QueryEvents", "query": "type in ['Word', 'Meg']"},
    ],
)
events = chain.run()
print(f"Chain: {len(events)} events, types: {events.type.unique().tolist()}")

# %%
# The dict form (``{"name": "QueryEvents", "query": "..."}`` ) is
# equivalent to ``QueryEvents(query="...")`` — it dispatches by name.
# This makes configs easy to serialize to YAML or JSON.
#
# .. seealso::
#
#    :doc:`06_chains` — full details on ``Chain`` composition, caching
#    placement, and how to configure pipelines effectively via ``Step``
#    fields.

#      - Extract audio tracks from Video events as separate Audio events

# %%
# Caching
# -------
#
# Transforms support caching via the ``infra`` parameter. This avoids
# recomputing expensive transforms (e.g. text processing) on every run:
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    transform = transforms.AddSentenceToWords(
#        infra={"backend": "Cached", "folder": "/cache"},
#    )
#    events = transform(events)  # cached on subsequent calls
#
# See `exca <https://github.com/facebookresearch/exca>`_ for all
# caching options.

# %%
# Advanced: Alignment and Chunking
# ---------------------------------
#
# **Alignment** —
# Suppose three subjects each heard the word "cat" at different times.
# You want to compare or **average their brain responses** to that word.
# :class:`~neuralset.events.transforms.AlignEvents` does this by
# regrouping events: for each unique stimulus (here each word), it
# builds a virtual :term:`timeline <Timeline>` — as if all subjects had
# been recorded in the same session — by gathering their neural
# recordings together and time-shifting them so the stimulus starts
# at ``t=0``.
#
# After alignment you can segment normally and the resulting dataset
# will have one segment per stimulus × subject, ready for cross-subject
# averaging or comparison.
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    transforms.AlignEvents(
#        trigger_type="Word",
#        trigger_field="text",
#        types_to_align="Meg",
#    )
#
# **Chunking** —
# :class:`~neuralset.events.transforms.ChunkEvents` splits long media
# events (``Audio``, ``Video``) into shorter segments, both to avoid
# out-of-memory errors and to prevent data leakage when extractors
# (e.g. transformer models) see more context than the segment window:
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#    transforms.ChunkEvents(
#        event_type_to_chunk="Audio",
#        max_duration=5.0,        # seconds
#        min_duration=2.0,        # avoid tiny leftover chunks
#    )

# %%
# Create Your Own
# ---------------
#
# Subclass :class:`~neuralset.events.transforms.EventsTransform` and
# implement ``_run(events) -> events``:

import pandas as pd


class DropShortEvents(transforms.EventsTransform):
    min_duration: float = 0.1

    def _run(self, events: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        return events.loc[events["duration"] >= self.min_duration]


demo_events = ns.events.standardize_events(
    pd.DataFrame(
        [
            dict(type="Word", start=1.0, duration=0.3, text="hello", timeline="run-01"),
            dict(type="Word", start=2.0, duration=0.05, text="x", timeline="run-01"),
            dict(type="Action", start=3.0, duration=0.02, timeline="run-01"),
        ]
    )
)

filtered = DropShortEvents(min_duration=0.1).run(demo_events)
print(f"{len(demo_events)} -> {len(filtered)} events")
